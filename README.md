# pinvault

**A personal, multi-media, distributed and social web archiving tool**

Easily download, organize and share every video, image, article, audio file and website you care about.
Think pinterest, mastodon, the internet archive and bittorrent mashed up in a single app.

## Vision
- **Content Extraction**: Pinvault makes it as easy as possible to save *only* the stuff you care about. Want to archive a youtube video? Using [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html), pinvault saves a simple video file. When archiving a page pinvault doesn't know how to process, you can choose the things it should extract with a few clicks.
- **Distribution**: Everything pinvault downloads is saved in [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). If you choose to publish a download's IPFS address, others can access the content even if the original source website is offline.
- **Follow anything, anywhere**: Using a few clicks, you can show pinvault how to monitor a webpage for new items and automatically download them, creating your own permanent, universal newsfeed.
- **Discover**: You can (optionally) set up pinvault on a server to follow other pinvault users and share your own activity!
